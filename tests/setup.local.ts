// a memory clean-up that runs while it waits releases the main event loop's handles against the spawn's own loop
// (oven-sh/bun#34069; the fix, oven-sh/bun#40078, is in no release yet). It froze one whole-suite run in about five
// when four ran at once here, and the test step on GitHub. A full clean-up just before each synchronous spawn leaves
// nothing for one to release while it waits. Remove this once the pinned Bun has the fix.

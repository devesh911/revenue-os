description: Use when running the per-task build loop — a /goal Mode B cycle or any session implementing a spec §12 task. The branch→RED→GREEN→gates→PR→verify-CI procedure, WIP cap, sentinels, residual protocol, and merge discipline.

# task-loop — thin router (skills advise, docs rule — CLAUDE.md)

## Read first, in this order
1. `docs/dev-workflow.md` §4B — the loop + roles (test-authorship rule for security/RLS/migration/guard-critical work) · §5 TDD mechanics · §6 DoD (goes in the PR body).
2. `docs/project-spec.md` §12 — your task + the acceptance-criteria protocol (agent-verifiable vs human-gated, D34) · §12b — the obligation/residual table.
3. `docs/dev-workflow.md` §3 — stack maintenance + solo-mode merge (D32).
4. `orchestrator/state/HANDOFF.md` — **USER NOTES first, every cycle** (Devesh's steering channel).

## The loop (D32-amended; every step blocking)
1. **WIP cap before anything:** ≥3 open unmerged task PRs ⇒ stop, emit `NEED_HUMAN: stack full — review bottom-up`.
2. Branch off the stack tip: `feat/task-NN-slug`.
3. **RED before GREEN** — failing tests from the acceptance criteria. Security/RLS/migration/guard-critical: the reviewer authors them itself (test-is-spec). **Dispatch, don't do (cost discipline):** when the `tester`/`worker`/`scout` agents are available, routine RED goes to `tester`, GREEN to `worker`, recon to `scout` — the main thread plans, briefs, and reviews only. Doing routine work in the main thread burns the expensive model on cheap work.
4. Gates: `bun test` · `bun run lint` · `bun run typecheck` · `bun run rls:check` when the DB is touched.
5. Push · `gh pr create` with the §6 checklist + a **⚠ residuals block** for human-gated criteria (D34).
6. **Verify the pipeline RAN:** `gh pr checks <N>` must show the required `checks` run concluded green **on GitHub**. An absent or red check is a stop signal — fix it or emit `NEED_HUMAN` (S13.7/D32). Local gate output never substitutes.
7. Update HANDOFF (incl. ESCALATIONS mirroring any `lessons.md` append) · checkpoint the orchestrator repo · take the next task or emit the sentinel. Never idle; never exceed the cap.

## Never (structural, not advisory — dev-workflow §12, S13; phase-independent)
Edit applied migrations · touch `.env`/secrets · force-push · add a dependency without a T24 BOM row · mutate an active agent/workflow version · approve a PR (in any phase) · edit `docs/**`/`CLAUDE.md` outside a commissioned or §13 ADR PR · merge anything while `STATE.md` says `PHASE: LIVE` (D36 — LIVE merges are ruleset-enforced human acts).

## Merge discipline (phase-aware — D36; check STATE.md line 1 first)
SETUP phase: agents merge — observed-green required `checks` + tested evidence + base==main confirmed (`gh pr view N --json baseRefName`) + ONE PR at a time, from the repo root. Independent branches squash; stacked branches keep merge commits (squash rewrites the patches above — D32). Never loop `gh pr merge` (lessons.md, 2026-07-10). LIVE phase: no agent merges, period.

## Learned since this router was written (dynamic — run it, don't skip)
`grep -inE 'gates|CI|pipe|worktree|queue|exit code' lessons.md` and read `STATE.md → DECISIONS`.
Findings there outrank this file's snapshot; on contradiction follow the lesson and note that this skill
needs a refresh. Standing examples this stanza would have caught: gates run BARE, pipes swallow exit
codes · diff queued/NEXT items against current main before executing (the #28 duplicate).

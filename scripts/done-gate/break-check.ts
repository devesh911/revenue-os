// The break check: for guardrail, tenancy and money code (broken-lines.ts), each line a change adds is broken on
// purpose, a condition on it flipped and the statement it starts removed, and at least one test must then fail (an
// assertion failing, or the test throwing). It runs in one scratch copy of the change (code-copy.ts): the test files
// that can reach a broken file by their imports each run once with coverage, to learn which run which line, and each
// broken copy then runs only the files that ran its line, stopping at the first that fails. Left out are the lines the
// coverage check leaves out (moved ones, ones whose comment alone changed, ones holding no code), a line no test runs
// (the coverage check's to report), and a line marked `// break-check gap: <why>` (break-marks.ts). The check has its
// own time limit, so the gate's stop never runs past its hook's; when it runs out, it names the lines not yet broken.

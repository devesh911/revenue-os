// its "Run: <link>" line (AGENTS.md → Definition of done). A slice main already has done keeps what its proof ran
// on: while its "Proof passed:" stays, its title, goal, Proof line, blocker and items stay too. GitHub is asked with
// plain GETs and no login: the repository is public and rules-from-main holds no token. Were it made private,
// GitHub would answer 404 and every such pull request would be refused, saying so, until rules-from-main's job is
// given `actions: read` and its token.

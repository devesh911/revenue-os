// Whether this run of .github/workflows/staging-migrations.yml may and must apply migrations to the cloud test
// database (staging), told to the workflow as `apply=true` or `apply=false`. First it asks GitHub whether `checks`
// passed on the commit (SHA): an automatic run starts only after ci passed, but a skipped `checks` still lets ci
// pass, and a hand run may name any commit of main. Then it links the project and reads `supabase migration list`:
// the commit's migrations go in only when it changed a migration file or the cloud lacks one it has (an earlier run
// was missed or failed). Anything it can't read fails the run; nothing here ever skips by guessing.

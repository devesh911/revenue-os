// Slice 1's proof steps (scripts/proof/slice-1*.ts). Its three worker steps run only in `bun run proof 1`, as Slice 0's
// whole-suite step does: each starts a real worker, which takes every company's due jobs from the one local database,
// and the whole-suite-at-once test (services/worker/test/test-runs-at-once.test.ts) runs this suite four times at once
// beside another company's queued calls that no test may take. What the worker answers is tested on the real
// database with a job schema of the test's own (services/worker/test/ready.test.ts); ci.yml's image build checks the
// image's label. Who the worker and the sign-in server refuse is tested in services/worker/test/orgs.test.ts,
// services/worker/test/sign-in.test.ts and tests/sign-up.test.ts.

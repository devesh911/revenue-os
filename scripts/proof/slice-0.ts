// Slice 0's proof steps, in the order ROADMAP.md → Slice 0 → Proof gives them, one per check it names. Each runs
// against the local stack and scratch clones, branches and repositories it makes and removes: it never pushes, opens
// a pull request, touches the cloud or runs a refused command (the gate's hook is only handed it). The step for
// GitHub's run records only reads them. The two steps a model takes part in wait on ANTHROPIC_EVALS_KEY.
